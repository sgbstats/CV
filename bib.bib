   abstract = {Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is a rare, aggressive vasculitis with no validated prediction tools to assist its management. We investigated a retrospective multicenter international cohort with the aim to transfer the Renal Risk Score (RRS) and to identify patients that benefit from rescue immunosuppressive therapy. Of a total 191 patients, 174 patients were included in the final analysis (57% female, median age 59 years). Using Cox and Kaplan-Meier methods, the RRS was found to be a strong and effective predictor for end stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a model concordance of C=0.760. The 36-month renal survival was 100%, 62.4%, and 20.7% in the low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (P<0.001). The need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) at diagnosis and the percentage of normal glomeruli in the biopsy were independent predictors of ESKD (P<0.001, P<0.001). Considering the 129 patients initially requiring RRT, the best predictor for renal recovery was the percentage of normal glomeruli (C=0.622; P<0.001), a split either side of 10% providing good stratification. A model with the predictors RRT and normal glomeruli (N) achieved superior discrimination (C=0.840, P<0.001). Dividing patients into four risk groups led to a 36-month renal survival of 96.4% (no RRT, N≥10%), 74.0% (no RRT, N<10%), 42.3% (RRT, N≥10%) and 14.1% (RRT, N<10%), respectively. In summary, we demonstrate that the RRS concept is transferrable to anti-GBM disease. Stratifying patients according to the need for RRT at diagnosis and renal histology improves prediction, highlighting the importance of normal glomeruli. Here, we propose a stratification to assist in the management of anti-GBM disease.},
